## What is spoofer?
### Spoofer is a tool that lets you change your Hardware ID in order to avoid getting HWID banned by quite many popular games such as Fortnite, Fivem, Apex, and so on...

## Make sure to use the latest version that can be downloaded in releases.

# Spoofer is fully written in C++ and its source is unprotected which means you can easily decompile it and see the code yourself.

# Detections may appear on various AVs as the main purpose of the tool is to change your HWID. 

Make sure to run this as Admin otherwise it may not work.

If you were already banned in some game, you can use this to avoid that ban, however this tool will not unban your account, but it will change HWID so they cannot detect your PC trying to start the game you're banned in.

If you found this repo helpful, it would mean a lot to leave a star and show some support.
